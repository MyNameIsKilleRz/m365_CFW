# m365_CFW
This is an attempt to reverse engineer and recreate the Xiaomi m365 Pro firmware

## In order to build this, you need some stuff first:

- The NORDIC SDK

- Some C knowledge if possible

- Some hardware knowledge if possible

- The values which you need to adjust in include/user_config.h

<p>Maybe I create a script which extracts the current values from a modified FIRM.bin file</p>

## For reverse engineering, head to the wiki of this project
