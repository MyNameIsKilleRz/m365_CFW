# m365_CFW
Attempt to recreate the Xiaomi m365 Pro firmware

In order to build this, you need some stuff first:

The NORDIC SDK

Some C knowledge if possible

Some hardware knowledge if possible

The values which you need to adjust in include/user_config.h




Maybe I create a script which extracts the current values from a modified FIRM.bin file
