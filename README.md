# m365_CFW / WIP NOT DONE

This is an attempt to reverse engineer and recreate the Xiaomi M365 Pro firmware.
Note: Currently, the Firmware is not working because i just started developing it :C
## Prerequisites

Before building this custom firmware, make sure you have the following:

- The NORDIC SDK
- Some C knowledge if possible
- Some hardware knowledge if possible
- The values which you need to adjust in `include/user_config.h`

Maybe I create a script which extracts the current values from a modified FIRM.bin file

## Getting Started

To get started with this custom firmware, follow these steps:

1. Install the NORDIC SDK.
2. Familiarize yourself with C programming language.
3. Acquire basic knowledge of the Xiaomi M365 Pro hardware.
4. Adjust the necessary values in `include/user_config.h` to match your scooter's model.
5. [Optional] Extract values from a modified FIRM.bin file using the provided script.
